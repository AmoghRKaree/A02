### _PART 2_ List Of Definitions

**Branch** : Branching is a feature within github that allows developers to work on segments of their code without breaking anything. Creating a branch makes an enviorment where you can implement or test new ideas so other parts of code arent messed up within the repository. <br/>
**Clone** : The idea of cloning revolves around copying all repository data from some repository, and being able to edit and test it locally. The reason for cloning is to test and debug projects safely so that they dont get messed with.<br/>
**Commit** : Commiting allows users to document changes to all of the users files within a repository. Each individual commit is a snapshot or even a mock "update" off your code.  <br/>
**Fetch** : Fetch or Git fetch is when you download the latest commit from a github remote repository, but you dont pull them into your own project yet. <br/>
**GIT** : Git in simple terms is a open source version control system which allows developers to store and put together projects in remote repositories. <br/>
**Github** : Github is an extension of GIT which is allowing users to upload reposotories onto a cloud making it easier for devlopers to share and save projects.<br/>
**Merge** : The act of merging is when you take a branch that you make changes to and merge it to a pre-existing branch that you didnt make changes to which is part of the main project. This is how you make big changes to projects.<br/>
**Merge Conflict** : A merge conflict is when you try to merge to branches that are incompatiable with each other.<br/>
**Push** : A git push is when you are sending all of the changes that you make to a project to a remote repository, in this case, github, to upload your project.<br/>
**Pull** : A git pull is when you are pulling or taking all of the data from a certain repository to edit or change things in a local enviorment.<br/>
**Remote** : A remote refers to the version of your repository, it servers as a location to access repositories.<br/>
**Repository** : A storage location for any project. <br/>
