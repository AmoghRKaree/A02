### _PART 1_ Directions on Using Webstorm

First Step:  Go to either of these websites and download the IDE / code editor.
https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/
https://code.visualstudio.com/

Second Step: Create a project, select new, make a project name, and select a language by ending with a .py or . java ending

Third Step: Configure Git in Webstorm or VScode, Get to version control and navigate to the Git option. Click test to check if it is executable. Click OK to save to settings.

Fourth Step: Create a File by right clicking on your project directory in the project panel. Name file and code.

Fifth Step: Check that your file is the correct version and add a VCS stage to them and commit changes to the file

Sixth Step: Push Changes to Github so they are stored on a remote cloud.

**Setting Up Git** : You can set up git and download using this link: https://git-scm.com/downloads. Then create a local repository by navigating to our prior projects folder. Then start to create our Github account in order to create our remote repository. Then we can link our local too remote. After than we can commit and post changes in order to upload from our local code editor to our new remote repository.

### _PART 2_ List Of Definitions

**Branch** : Branching is a feature within github that allows developers to work on segments of their code without breaking anything. Creating a branch makes an enviorment where you can implement or test new ideas so other parts of code arent messed up within the repository. <br/><br/>
**Clone** : The idea of cloning revolves around copying all repository data from some repository, and being able to edit and test it locally. The reason for cloning is to test and debug projects safely so that they dont get messed with.<br/><br/>
**Commit** : Commiting allows users to document changes to all of the users files within a repository. Each individual commit is a snapshot or even a mock "update" off your code.  <br/><br/>
**Fetch** : Fetch or Git fetch is when you download the latest commit from a github remote repository, but you dont pull them into your own project yet. <br/><br/>
**GIT** : Git in simple terms is a open source version control system which allows developers to store and put together projects in remote repositories. <br/><br/>
**Github** : Github is an extension of GIT which is allowing users to upload reposotories onto a cloud making it easier for devlopers to share and save projects.<br/><br/>
**Merge** : The act of merging is when you take a branch that you make changes to and merge it to a pre-existing branch that you didnt make changes to which is part of the main project. This is how you make big changes to projects.<br/><br/>
**Merge Conflict** : A merge conflict is when you try to merge to branches that are incompatiable with each other.<br/><br/>
**Push** : A git push is when you are sending all of the changes that you make to a project to a remote repository, in this case, github, to upload your project.<br/><br/>
**Pull** : A git pull is when you are pulling or taking all of the data from a certain repository to edit or change things in a local enviorment.<br/><br/>
**Remote** : A remote refers to the version of your repository, it servers as a location to access repositories.<br/><br/>
**Repository** : A storage location for any project. <br/>
